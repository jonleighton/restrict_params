h2. Restrict Params

Restrict Params is a Rails plugin which enables you to specify a finite set of keys
which can appear in the parameters being passed to an action.

h2. Why?

If you use a RESTful architecture, you use the @create@ and @update@ actions to modify
resources. Depending on the access priveliges of the application, you might want to,
for example, allow admins to modify all attributes of a Company model, but only allow
general users to modify the "notes" attribute.

h2. Example

<pre><code>class CompaniesController < ApplicationController
  restrict_params :to => [:notes], :only => :update, :if => "!current_user.admin?"
end</code></pre>

The plugin will look at the class name of your controller and figure out that we need
to inspect @params[:company]@. If @current_user.admin?@ is false, it will delete all items
from @params[:company]@ except @:notes@.
